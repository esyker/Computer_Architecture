# Elementar Processing Unit (PU)

In order to carry out this work, a Processing Unit composed of an ALU, a
storage unit with registers, memory and multiplexers. The unit is fully implemented and
tested, and can be found in the DP.zip file found on the ***problem-statement*** folder.

In this project we intend to analyze and characterize the provided Processing Unit and make the synthesis of new functionalities for the processing unit (PU).

Check ***problem-statement*** to check the requirements for the implementation of the solution.
Check ***solution*** for the implemented code/reporting done.
